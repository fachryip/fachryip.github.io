Soon after Food Express project enter finishing phase, Polytron need quiz app for internal event. Our team took the task to create a trivia game with randomize question for each player. Question and anwer will be put in server so the changes in question can be made without repetitive build. After player answer question, there is a NPC that will react based on user answer. 

This is a simple game, the challenge is this is a first game that I create in WebGL. There is also some feature for example when player disconnect, because we want to create seamless experience, so when that player connect again it will display last question or last state. Game will receive that info from URL when player open app.
