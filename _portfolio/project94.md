Now we move into 3D Game! Wohooo! After last two game in Polytron is in 2D, this time we, again, challenge ourself to a more difficult project. This is the time we will develop our game for android tv, especially Polytron TV. 

This game is such a challenge because we want to have a glow effect like a neon lamp (hence the name has neon in it), but because the target device is a low-end device we cannot have any post processing in it. So after more iteration, we decided to give glow effect just from the texture itself. 

There are 3 stages in this game: City, Space and Volcano with each theme will order sequentially and recursively. There is random mechanism for obstacle. We have more than 10 set of obstacle that will spawn randomly in each theme. Each obstacle is graded easy, normal and hard. So when start, only easy obstacle that appear. More and more distance player has, more difficult obstacle will appear more easily.

Also this time, we introduce Nagih Coin. Nagih Coin can be used to buy item from across the game that tied to google play account. So when playing game A player acquired 100 Nagih Coin. When playing game B player already have 100 Nagih Coin that they can use to buy in game item. This system is developed by another team, I just call the API to get the data and shown them on screen
