This project created when I was in Polytron. Me myself as a sole programmer and 2 other people working on this. For a new team, this project aim to bring communication, teamwork and synergy and to test skill of each member. 

In this game, there is a card and a number text. Each time, a card is draw from the deck and the number on text is increasing each time. To earn score, we must tap the card when the number shown on card and number on text is match. To win you must get highest score.

Another feature is save and get data from remote server. This is the first time for me, but I make a decent working code out of it. There is also "online" mode, where you get to play with other people. Why the quote? because it's not really synchonous. By other people we mean get data from other player that match the skill of player, created an online persona and add them to AI. So essentially player still match againts AI, the different is, when the data that gathered from server is a skilled player, the AI will match that and vice versa.
