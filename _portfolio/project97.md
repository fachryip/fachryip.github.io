This game is created when I was in Melon Gaming. Now I'm a full fledge Game Developer. Right now I'm using javascript with melonjs library to create web games. I read some books about javascript and do training in melonjs for 1 month. After that I develop this game with 2 other people. Melonjs has an editor, but the editor itself is still in developed at the time. So I frequently use the good old plain javascript. 

The game mechanic is like Summoners War. You can summon and army with some mana that regen over time. You must destroy enemy base, and defend yours. There are many variation of army, solider, sniper, drone, and tower. The soldier attack melee has high hp but cannot attack flying unit. Sniper attack range has low hp but can attack all unit. Drone is flying and has low hp with medium attack. Tower attack range but cannot move. Each unit is moved with AI.
