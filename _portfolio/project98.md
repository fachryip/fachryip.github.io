This game is created when I was still a junior game programmer in Agate International with 2 other programmers. ESports King is divided into 2 section, House and Game. House is where you build your team, buy furniture, plan strategy, equip items, see quests and many more. Your team member itself  is visible in the House. Your team member will move automatically like the sims. They have needs, like hunger, sleep, etc and will move to furniture to relinquish their need or move random inside the House. My responsibility is in the House.

The biggest challenge of course is the team member. I created the Artificial Intellegence using Behaviour AI. Every tick they check their need. For example check if they need sleep. If they do, they will locate furniture that can replenish sleep. If said furniture is located and if that furniture is not operated by anyone, they will move to furniture and use it. If they don't need sleep, they will check their other need. If they didn't need anything they will move randomly inside the House.
