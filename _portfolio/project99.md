First unity game created when still in university. Me as a sole programmer and my other 2 friends wanted to create a game that can be show to other people. We also participate in a game contest called IN.GAME 2016 and nominated for most innovative game. 

The game itself is a simple puzzle platformer where there is a ball that move horizontal automatically. When the ball hit a wall, the ball will change its direction. From right to left, from left to right. You as the player can only control the ball by using jump with a tap. Avoid obstacle and go to designated marker to win the game.
