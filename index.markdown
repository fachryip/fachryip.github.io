Hello! I’m Fachry, a game programmer from Indonesia. I’ve been making games since I was a college student for a hobby project. Now after 7 years, I'm still making games and still love doing it. Currently working as Lead Game Programmer at Polytron, specializing at making multiplayer games for TV devices.
